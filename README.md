This is a very basic project that alows me the have fun with basic physic simulations.
One ball is droped and bounces on the floor, you can click anywhere on the window to make the ball drop from somewhere else.

Few bugs:
The ball never stops bouncing.
The ball clips into the ground.
(if you have a solution i am open to suggestions.)
